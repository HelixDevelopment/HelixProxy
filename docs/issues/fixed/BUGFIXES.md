## BUGFIX-0001 — `run-tests.sh` aborts after the first test under `set -e`

- **Type:** Bug (script-internal failure — Helix Constitution §11.4.1)
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Date:** 2026-06-30
- **Affected file:** `tests/run-tests.sh` (`test_result()`)

### Symptom

`bash tests/run-tests.sh` printed only its banner and the first test's
section header, then exited `1` (7 lines of output total) — every test
after the first was silently never run, and no `TEST SUMMARY` was
printed.

### Reproduction (captured, run in-session before the fix)

```
$ bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; x=0; ((x++)); echo "SURVIVED, x=$x"'; echo "exit=$?"
exit=1                      # "SURVIVED" never printed

$ bash tests/run-tests.sh 2>&1 | wc -l
7                           # aborted; exit=1
```

### Root cause (FACT — not a guess, Helix Constitution §11.4.6)

`test_result()` counted with the bash post-increment idiom
`(( TESTS_RUN++ ))`. The arithmetic command `(( expr ))` returns exit
status **1** when `expr` evaluates to **0**. `TESTS_RUN++` is a
*post*-increment, so its value is the value *before* incrementing — `0`
on the very first call — making `(( TESTS_RUN++ ))` return status 1.
The script runs under `set -euo pipefail` (line 7), so that non-zero
status aborted the entire suite at the first `test_result` call, before
any results or the summary could print. The same trap applied to the
first `PASS` (`(( TESTS_PASSED++ ))`) and first `FAIL`
(`(( TESTS_FAILED++ ))`).

This was a **pre-existing** latent defect (the `(( ... ++ ))` idiom was
original); it surfaced while wiring the constitution-inheritance
pre-flight gate in as the first test.

### Fix (at source, Helix Constitution §11.4.1)

Replaced the three post-increment arithmetic commands with the
assignment form, which always returns status 0 and is immune to the
`set -e` trap:

```diff
- ((TESTS_RUN++))
+ TESTS_RUN=$((TESTS_RUN + 1))
- ((TESTS_PASSED++))
+ TESTS_PASSED=$((TESTS_PASSED + 1))
- ((TESTS_FAILED++))
+ TESTS_FAILED=$((TESTS_FAILED + 1))
```

### Verification (captured, run in-session after the fix)

```
$ bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; x=0; x=$((x+1)); echo "SURVIVED, x=$x"'; echo "exit=$?"
SURVIVED, x=1
exit=0

$ bash tests/run-tests.sh 2>&1 | wc -l
28                          # suite now runs to completion (was 7)
# first line of results:
✓ PASS: Constitution inheritance gate (§11.4.35)
```

The suite now executes every test and prints its summary. (Its overall
exit remains non-zero in an environment without the running proxy
services — those are real-infrastructure tests that correctly FAIL/skip
when the live System is absent, Helix Constitution §11.4.11 — that is a
separate, pre-existing, infrastructure-dependent condition, not this
defect.)
