# CONTINUATION — Helix Proxy: VPN-Aware Dynamic Routing Extension

**Revision:** 26
**Last modified:** 2026-07-02T17:23:22Z
**Status:** Active — **Rev-26 wave (2026-07-02, HEAD `22c9c30`): ALL FOUR operator directives COMPLETE (committed + pushed to origin/main, FF §11.4.113).** **(P1 Mullvad WG egress)** persistent ONE-DEVICE "groovy rabbit" (id `df4184d4-…`) + gitignored `.env` mullvad-native config; **live egress `mullvad_exit_ip=true` deterministic 3/3** (Prague/Düsseldorf/San Jose — invariant holds every run) + **kill-switch fail-closed 3/3** (§11.4.68 tunnel-down⇒egress-BLOCKED wget-RC=4, gluetun-healthcheck "operation not permitted" corroborated); feature Status `docs/design/mullvad_egress/` (`22c9c30`); evidence `qa-results/verification/mullvad_egress_20260702T161312Z/PROOF.txt` + `qa-results/mullvad_killswitch/20260702T165417Z/`. §11.4.10 secret-safe (0 account/key/addr in any tracked file/PDF); §11.4.10.A pre-store audit CLEAN; host routing untouched (§11.4.174). **(P2 ports→34XXX)** HTTP-Squid `34128` / SOCKS-Dante `34080` / Admin+Control-API `34088` (`34081` avoided — a foreign java holds host `:34081`, §11.4.174) / Metrics `34090`: `80cbcd2` (62 behavior files + §11.4.135 guard `port_prefix_34xxx_test.sh` GREEN+RED) + gap-fix `754bd2a` (4 missed challenge/runner scripts still on old ports — §11.4.118-discovered by the doc-sync agent, guard scan-scope extended to challenges/+runner) + doc-sync `ca0b6a4` (111 current-behavior doc files; HISTORICAL narrative PRESERVED, §11.4.6). Verified: guard GREEN+RED, `podman-compose config` rc=0 rendering 34XXX, control-plane `go test -short` 0 FAIL, run-tests 84/10/0. **(P3 HelixQA vendored + built, decoupled)** 6 own-org siblings at flat layout `90ca75f` (doc_processor/llm_orchestrator/llm_provider/vision_engine @master, llms_verifier/security @main); **`helixqa` binary BUILDS + RUNS in-tree** (`go build ./cmd/helixqa` exit 0, `helixqa v0.2.0`, 548 test cases parsed); its DECOUPLED build fix (go.mod `llmsverifier => ../llms_verifier/llm-verifier` subdir + `helix-deps.yaml` master refs — F1/F2 found by the build subagent) committed `a6c8c2e` + **pushed to all 3 HelixQA mirrors** (github×2 + gitlab, integrated onto latest upstream `64eb44b` §11.4.113); `install_upstreams` wired multi-mirror push on all 6; evidence `qa-results/helixqa_vendor_20260702T170441Z/` + `qa-results/helixqa_build/20260702T162857Z/`. **(P4 DNS)** deferred by operator — LE Phase 4/6 Operator-blocked (reason "operator-deferred DNS 2026-07-02"), documented `3170e50`. **Session commits (all FF-pushed):** `80cbcd2`·`3170e50`·`754bd2a`·`ca0b6a4`·`90ca75f`·`22c9c30` (+ helix_qa `a6c8c2e` upstream). **Live e2e DONE (§11.4.108, evidence `qa-results/proxy_helixqa_e2e_34xxx/20260702T171101Z/`):** ad-hoc rootless-podman proxy on the new ports — **HTTP `:34128` 200×3** (real body + squid access.log `TCP_MISS/200`, cache `TCP_MEM_HIT/200`) + **SOCKS `:34080` 200×3**; **HelixQA proxy bank 4/5 PASS** (http_forward/https_through/socks5_http/socks5_https PASS via the built `helixqa` binary; cache FAIL = gnu.org ORIGIN 403 bot-block, NOT a proxy defect — same URL 200 via curl). **FINDING (§11.4.108 artifact-staleness, owed):** the `dynamic`-profile squid IMAGE (`localhost/helixproxy-squid-dynamic:dev`) was built PRE-migration → serves `http_port :53128` internally while compose publishes `34128`; SOURCE is clean (`squid.dynamic.conf` = `34128`, guard-verified), so the fix is a squid-dynamic IMAGE REBUILD via the project's MULTI-STAGE build (needs the `controlplane` stage + `config/squid` build context) — an ad-hoc `podman build` this session failed (rc=125: wrong context/missing stage), confirming the rebuild belongs to the podman-gated dynamic-stack build; the dynamic image self-corrects to `34128` at the next stack rebuild. Source clean + statically proven, so this is artifact-staleness only, not a source defect. Subagent-driven §11.4.70/§11.4.103 (throttle recovered mid-session → 3 parallel subagents sustained; 1 crash respawned §11.4.147); every claim carries captured physical evidence (§11.4/§11.4.6, no bluff). **Owed next (operator-gated / not-yet):** full proxy-data-plane-THROUGH-gluetun e2e (needs dynamic stack up); host podman/aardvark-dns reset (shared host); real-device flash; release tag. **Rev-25 wave (2026-07-02): two operator directives DOCUMENTED.** **(Part 1) Mullvad WireGuard egress — COMPLETE:** a persistent ONE-DEVICE Mullvad WireGuard identity was registered against the operator's Mullvad account via the current app API (`POST /auth/v1/token` → `POST /accounts/v1/devices`; the legacy `/wg` endpoint is deprecated), device "groovy rabbit" (id `df4184d4-b6e9-4c2e-b7f7-16e15d4e55a2`), creds stored in the gitignored `.env` (`VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=mullvad` + WireGuard key + assigned address — §11.4.10; §11.4.10.A pre-store leak audit CLEAN, 0 tree/history leaks). **LIVE EGRESS PROVEN:** gluetun in rootless podman brought up a kernelspace WireGuard tunnel (relay `cz-prg-wg-101`) and `am.i.mullvad.net/json` returned `mullvad_exit_ip=true` (exit IP `146.70.129.117`, Prague, Czech Republic); "one same device" is guaranteed by reusing the persistent private key; host routing untouched (§11.4.174), verification container torn down (§11.4.14). Evidence: `qa-results/verification/mullvad_egress_20260702T161312Z/PROOF.txt`. This RESOLVES the P10 real-VPN-egress §11.4.21 operator gate (`docs/design/hardening/Status.md` Rev 7); the full proxy-data-plane-through-gluetun e2e + up→drop tcpdump killswitch half remain the next step (§3 OWED-TO-P10). **(Part 4) live DNS DEFERRED by the operator (2026-07-02):** Let's Encrypt Phase 4/6 (live HTTPS issuance/renewal/rotation) stays **OPERATOR-BLOCKED, reason "operator-deferred DNS (2026-07-02)"**, unblock = operator-provided LE account + DNS credentials (`docs/design/letsencrypt/Status.md` Rev 4); the hermetic Phase-3/5 issuance/rotation guards remain GREEN — only the live-cert half is deferred. **(prior)** **§11.4.126 autonomous loop** (operator: "keep hardening, don't tag yet" + "3-4 parallel subagents, rock-solid evidence, no bluff" + **"all future work on `main`"**). **Rev-24 wave (HEAD `860d38e`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **anti-bluff audit ledger CLOSED + core evidence library provably audited.** `c44e90c` **#74/#75** (F-C `vpn_failclosed` all-timeout SKIP reason → honest inconclusive; F-D `memory_soak` degenerate-final-RSS-sample → honest SKIP not "bounded" — each §11.4.135-guarded, single-source, conductor-inline-reviewed). `860d38e` **#76 (F-E, MEDIUM)** — an INLINE §11.4.118 audit of the core `tests/lib/evidence.sh` (which the dynamic-audit had EXCLUDED) found + DEMONSTRATED a THIRD absence-as-evidence bluff at the LIBRARY ROOT: `assert_no_leak` scored an EMPTY/malformed capture as "no leak" PASS (reachable via `no_leak_analyzer.sh:62`); fixed FAIL-closed (empty→FAIL; fallback branch requires positive tcpdump structure) with NO false-FAIL (a genuine tcpdump-footer-0 still PASSes) + 3 selftest negatives (48/48) + a §11.4.135 guard `assert_no_leak_empty_capture_test.sh`, conductor-inline-reviewed. **Then audited the WHOLE core evidence library** (§11.4.118 completeness): 8 verdict helpers — `ab_pass_with_evidence` (empty/absent→FAIL), `ab_skip_with_reason` (invalid reason→FAIL rc2), `proxy_conn_verdict` (timeout can't PASS), `wg_transfer_delta` (flat/missing→FAIL), `assert_egress_ip` (unverifiable half→OPERATOR-BLOCKED not PASS, §11.4.68/F7), `assert_cache_hit` (requires access.log `TCP_*HIT`), `assert_graceful_503` (timeout/blank/PID-change→FAIL) all verified fail-closed-SOLID; only `assert_no_leak` had a bluff (F-E, now fixed). **AUDIT LEDGER COMPLETE — SIX findings:** F1 (#71/#72) · F-A/F-B (#73) · F-C/F-D (#74/#75) · F-E (#76), all §11.4.118-discovered → RED-first fixed → §11.4.135-guarded (a standing regression suite of 4 new guards: security-group-critical-gate, chaos-no-leak-argshape, vpn_failclosed-reason, memory_soak-degenerate, assert_no_leak-empty). **⚠ Throttle oscillates:** saturates even SOLO dispatches when the rolling rate window is full, recovers after ~10min of conductor-inline (no-dispatch) work; **conductor-inline review is throttle-immune AND a valid §11.4.70/§11.4.142 reviewer for subagent-authored fixes** (conductor ≠ builder subagent) — it reviewed #73/#74/#75/#76 + captured #69 this session. **The non-operator-gated actionable queue is now EXHAUSTED** (all ledger tasks done, audit ledger closed, evidence library provably clean). Remaining is ALL operator-gated: live svord bridge (biggest unlock — flips ~16 protocol SKIPs to live PASS + a full data-plane e2e), LE #59, podman aardvark-dns compose-network, real-device flash, HelixQA 6-sibling vendoring. No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-23 wave (HEAD `3ec39d3`+doc, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **#73 (second demonstrated bluff) CLOSED + #69 RESOLVED.** (a) Solo dynamic-audit `ac3f1c89` found **F-A**: `chaos_suite.sh` C1 no-leak proof was VACUOUS — the call site passed a full URL to `no_leak_analyzer` which greps tcpdump ` IP .*<t>` (IPs, never scheme-prefixed URLs) → leak count always 0 → no-leak PASS regardless of a REAL leak (same §11.4.107(10) class as F1); + **F-B** empty-capture silently skipped the analyzer. Fixed RED-first `3ec39d3` (`chaos_target_leak_key` resolves URL→host→IP; `chaos_leak_signal` rc 2 UNEVALUATED→honest SKIP; §11.4.135 guard `chaos_no_leak_argshape_test.sh`, RED_MODE polarity, single-source via `CHAOS_SOURCE_ONLY`). Reviewed INLINE by the conductor (the review subagent crashed on the throttle; conductor ≠ builder-subagent author → valid §11.4.70/§11.4.142); guard load-bearing under sh+bash; no_leak_analyzer.sh unchanged. F-C/F-D tasked LOW (#74/#75). (b) **#69 RESOLVED (§11.4.6 correction):** ran `go test -run Integration -v ./...` on control-plane → **14 real PASS / 1 honest §11.4.3 SKIP / 0 FAIL** against REAL podman Postgres/redis/gluetun (evidence `qa-results/integration/control-plane_verbose_20260702T125403Z/`). A prior round had wrongly marked Integration PENDING assuming podman was unusable — FACT: the aardvark-dns break is compose-network-only, NOT ad-hoc `podman run`. Hardening matrix (Status Rev 6): **Integration PENDING→PASS**; **E2E PENDING→honest §11.4.3 SKIP** (no in-project e2e suite; end-to-end covered by the P10 fail-closed proof + the integration path; a full compose-network-wired stack e2e is operator-gated). **⚠ THROTTLE now saturates even SOLO dispatches** (~16 subagents this session → rolling rate window full); shifted to conductor-INLINE work (throttle-immune) — which independently reviewed #73 AND captured #69. **Next:** #74/#75 (LOW) when the rate cools. No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-22 wave (HEAD `159fcbc`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **#67 COMPLETE — Go control-plane §11.4.169 resilience gap closed** in 3 independently-reviewed slices: DDoS `0c51f61` (loadflood + decide-flood; calibrated-per-run p99 + goroutine/fd leak census + Type-4 torn-read fold), memory-soak `ceb4839` (growth-ratio N-invariant 1.11-1.13; caught+fixed a fake-audit-accumulation false-fail via `drainFakeAudit`), chaos `159fcbc` (store-drop-mid-`WithTx` rollback / SSE-disconnect reap / ctx-cancel honest-SKIP / redis-unavailable → zero `(true,*)` leaks across the outage). All in-process httptest — no Postgres/redis/podman/netns; each §1.1-load-bearing (reviews a02f558f / a74e23fd / a139f9ec GO). Concurrency was already covered (concurrency_test.go + atomicity_test.go + `-race`) — the #67-design correctly avoided a duplicate suite (§11.4.6/§11.4.27). **§11.4.6 honesty update:** the hardening §11.4.169 matrix's green DDoS/chaos/memory rows had cited DATA-PLANE Squid evidence ONLY — the Go server had no such coverage; matrix now updated (`docs/design/hardening/Status.md` Rev 5 + Status_Summary Rev 5) to reflect the new Go-control-plane coverage, and the F1 fix+guard recorded in the hardening Security row. **⚠ Throttle: STRICTLY single-stream, confirmed 3× incl. the minimal 1+1 case** — any subagent dispatched while another runs crashes on the server-rate throttle; done retesting (retests just waste dispatches). Effective parallelism = 1 subagent + conductor-inline work. **Next (single-stream):** #69 (control-plane integration/e2e evidence re-capture, §11.4.40 pre-tag — likely operator/podman-gated → honest §11.4.3 SKIP) + respawn the dynamic-suite bluff-audit (§11.4.118, throttle-crashed 3×). No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-21 wave (HEAD `5771a46`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** four more single-stream landings + an anti-bluff win. `c32dcad` healthd coverage 70.3→79.3% (run() fail-closed + `-version` tests, review `a07d4ca4` GO, load-bearing). **F1 arc (§11.4.118→§11.4.6→§11.4.135):** a tight-scoped bluff-audit (`a1bf492d`) found `proxy_acl_security.sh` aggregated `≥1 PASS && 0 FAIL ⇒ group PASS` — so a non-critical S3-only pass reported the group GREEN *naming S4 "GREEN live"* while the security-critical S1/S4 SKIPped (plausibly LIVE on the broken-podman host); `6e3e031` **FIX** (group PASS now requires S1&&S4 to actually pass, else SKIP naming the absent one; run-tests headline honest; review `aefcdb5d` GO, adversarial-revert-proven) → `adca02e` **§11.4.135 standing guard** (single-source `tests/lib/acl_group_verdict.sh` + RED_MODE regression test wired into the suite; review `a5ff11ac` GO — reverting the lib gate flips the guard to FAIL). `5771a46` **#68** wired the 2 orphaned harnesses (`container_boot.sh` + `discovery_reflect.sh`) into the Challenge bank (both honest-SKIP, runner RESULT OK total=8/SKIP=8, review `ab1783f4` GO) — §11.4.135 orphan gap closed. **⚠ Throttle STILL caps concurrency (§11.4.6, empirically RE-tested):** dispatching 2 new subagents concurrent with 1 running → BOTH new crashed on the transient throttle at ~25s while the pre-existing single stream survived + GO'd. So **single-stream sequential** remains the sustainable pace; 3-4 parallel is environment-blocked right now, not a choice. **Pending (single-stream):** respawn #67-design (control-plane resilience blueprint) + the dynamic-suite bluff-audit (both throttle-crashed); then #67 build; #69 (integration evidence, likely operator/podman-gated). No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-20 wave (HEAD `85d8b32`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **#65 sniff fan-out LANDED.** `85d8b32` replicates the underlay-sniff AF_PACKET non-leak differential onto 3 protocol harnesses (`hermetic_bridge_run.sh` marker `$DEV_NAME` / `_ftp_run.sh` `$NONCE` / `_webdav_run.sh` `$NONCE`) — a verbatim single-source clone of the ethertype-guarded substrate `_emit_an_py` analyzer; NORMAL `ciphertext(0x04 :51820)=present`+marker-`absent`, `SNIFF_MUT=plain` load-bearing (only plaintext-absent flips, ciphertext stays present); the `:9` discard port stays distinct from each §11.4.111 TCP negative-control port. **Email is honest N/A** (implicit-TLS encrypts the token *below* WG → a plaintext-absent underlay sniff is tautologically true regardless of the tunnel, a §11.4-forbidden vacuous test; N/A note in the harness header + `docs/scripts/hermetic_email_run.md`). Provenance (§11.4.147): the builder `a9cb5106` crashed on a transient server throttle at ~13 min, but its work was **conductor-verified inline** (preserve→resume — all 3 NORMAL PASS + `SNIFF_MUT=plain` load-bearing + original teeth regression-clean) then **independently reviewed `a1dca6fd` GO 7/7**. This doc-sync marks FINDINGS §7.1 IMPLEMENTED + adds §11.4.18 sniff notes to the 3 harness companion docs + Status pair → Rev 9. **⚠ Throttle note (§11.4.6):** a server-side transient throttle ("Server is temporarily limiting requests — NOT your usage limit") crashed **3 of 4** concurrent subagents (#65 builder, bluff-audit, #67-design) → dropped to **single-stream sequential** dispatch (a single subagent survives; a 4-wide fan-out throttles). **Pending (single-stream as the throttle allows):** Go-coverage-healthd review (`a0f6ad3` GO'd — `control-plane/cmd/healthd/main_lifecycle_test.go` raises healthd 70.3→79.3%, untracked, awaiting review→commit); respawn the crashed shell-bluff-audit + #67-design; then #67/#68/#69. No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-19 wave (HEAD `172eb5c`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **session-limit reset → landed #66 + #70 (both independent §11.4.142 GO).** `b66b2fa` **#66** wired `hermetic_email_run.sh` into the `test_vpn_lan_hermetic` standing guard — closing the §11.4.6/§11.4.135 doc-bluff the §11.4.169 ledger audit caught (email was `refs=0` in run-tests.sh while the docs claimed all four wired); independent review `a5bc6266` GO 6/6, the REAL loop (temp copy inside tests/ for correct readonly SCRIPT_DIR) shows ALL 5 rows PASS incl `VPN-LAN hermetic: Email … PASS`, verdict-map adversarially confirmed to send a harness FAIL→loop-FAIL (never silent-SKIP), honest-SKIP intact; docs re-corrected to "4 wired". `172eb5c` **#70** adopted the found orphan test `control-plane/cmd/acl-helper/main_run_test.go` (§11.4.124 — a prior session's uncommitted coverage PWU, never debris; covers `run()` fail-closed Redis-connect + `main()` `-version`); independent review `aae14631` GO — race-clean, 80.8% pkg coverage, LOAD-BEARING (both fail-open mutations of `run()`'s guard kill the test). Session-limit reset was awaited via a backgrounded `until` clock-wait (autonomous, no operator round-trip). **In flight (parallel):** #65 sniff fan-out builder (`a9cb5106`, netns owner — 3 harnesses bridge/ftp/webdav + honest email N/A note per FINDINGS §7.1) + shell-bluff-audit respawn (`a67c0093`, read-only §11.4.118). **Next:** review+land #65 (→ FINDINGS §7.1 implemented + Status sniff rows); triage bluff-audit findings; then Go-coverage respawn + #67/#68/#69. No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-18 wave (HEAD `cdb0ccd`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **#64 ethertype guard LANDED + 4-parallel-stream fan-out + a §11.4.169 ledger audit that caught a real doc-bluff (corrected).** `cdb0ccd`: a one-line Ethernet-ethertype guard on the underlay-sniff frame analyzer (skip non-`0x0800` frames — VLAN offset shift, structurally impossible on the fresh veth, correct-by-construction), refactored to single-source `_emit_an_py()`/`scan_frames()` so a `--selftest-analyzer` exercises the SAME parser; independent §11.4.142 review `af9f67ad` = GO 5/5 with the decisive load-bearing proof (WITH guard `vlan_ct=absent` PASS; WITHOUT, scratch-neutralized, `vlan_ct=present` FAIL). Per the operator directive, dispatched **4 parallel streams** (§11.4.103): #64 review (GO→landed); a #65 fan-out **DESIGN** (§11.4.150) that PREVENTED a bluff — the sniff is meaningful for **3** harnesses (bridge/ftp/webdav, plaintext-under-WG) but **N/A for email** (implicit-TLS encrypts the token *below* WG, so "plaintext absent on the underlay" is tautologically true regardless of the tunnel — a §11.4-forbidden vacuous test); a §11.4.169 test-type **ledger reconciliation** (COMPLETED, real findings); and Go-coverage + shell-bluff-audit streams (both **CRASHED on session limits** — §11.4.147 incomplete-not-done, respawn after the ~09:30Z reset, no work lost). **The ledger surfaced a genuine documentation bluff (§11.4.6/§11.4.135/§11.4.138):** `docs/features/vpn_lan/Status.md` claimed all FOUR hermetic protocol legs are wired standing-suite guards, but `hermetic_email_run.sh` is `refs=0` in `run-tests.sh` (conductor-verified — only substrate+Cast/FTP/WebDAV wired at :1006-1009). **Corrected the doc to reality this wave** (3 wired + email reviewed-GO-but-wiring-pending) and tasked the actual wiring **#66**; also tasked **#67** (control-plane Go stress/chaos/DDoS/memory §11.4.169 gap), **#68** (orphaned `container_boot.sh` + `discovery_reflect.sh`), **#69** (re-capture integration/e2e evidence, §11.4.40 pre-tag). `FINDINGS.md`→Rev 5 (§7 #64-landed + §7.1 fan-out design), VPN-LAN Status pair→Rev 7, README rows. **Next (session-limit-gated ~09:30Z):** land #65 (3-harness sniff fan-out + honest email N/A note) + #66 (email suite-wiring) with independent review; respawn the crashed coverage + bluff-audit streams (§11.4.147). No tag ("keep hardening"). **Rev-17 wave (HEAD `91af9c6`, branch `main`, FF to origin):** **§11.4.107 underlay-sniff AF_PACKET non-leak differential landed on the WG substrate.** `91af9c6` adds to `hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh` a rootless `AF_PACKET` capture on the underlay `veth0` during the positive round-trip asserting BOTH (a) WG **ciphertext present** (type-4 `0x04` datagram to `:51820`) AND (b) the per-run **plaintext nonce ABSENT** in raw underlay bytes — a different-domain oracle (§11.4.107(2)) + the canonical WireGuard self-audit method; the third independent layer of the tunnel-integrity claim after §11.4.111 destination-binding + wrong-destination negative. **Independent §11.4.142 review `a2b3c696` = GO on 11/11 checks against real runs (§11.4.134):** load-bearing golden-bad `SNIFF_MUT=plain` (emits the nonce as cleartext UDP to discard `:9`, distinct from the §11.4.111 TCP `:8080` control) flips ONLY assertion (b) to FAIL 3/3 while ciphertext stays present (not a tautology, §11.4.107(10)); NORMAL → `ciphertext(0x04 :51820)=present plaintext_nonce=absent` 3/3; header-only pcap → analyzer exit 3 (honest FAIL); forced-iface + no-tcpdump → honest `SNIFF-SKIP`; `WG_MUT=badkey` tooth undisturbed (sniff sits past the `UP!=1` gate); veth0-only capture, 3.5 s / 4 MB / `timeout`-bounded, `SNIFF_PID` reaped, `wg0-mullvad` untouched (§11.4.174); `sh -n` + `bash -n` clean. `FINDINGS.md` → Rev 4 §7 (PLANNED → IMPLEMENTED). Two tracked follow-ups: **task #64** one-line Ethernet-ethertype guard on the frame analyzer (reviewer nit — VLAN offset shift, structurally impossible on the harness's own fresh veth, correct-by-construction); **task #65** fan the differential out to the 4 protocol harnesses (bridge/ftp/webdav/email), each with a per-protocol plaintext marker + its own `SNIFF_MUT=plain`. **Anti-bluff §11.4.118 pass this wave:** a mechanical smell-scan of all 26 test scripts (bare `ab_pass`, `|| true`-before-verdict, fail-open SKIP→PASS, unconditional PASS) came back clean — enumerated coverage evidence, with the honest boundary that grep cannot catch a *semantic* tautology (only adversarial re-run can, as in the #62 negative-control fix). **Next: task #64 (tiny) or #65 (fan-out) — the loop continues (no tag — "keep hardening").** **Rev-16 wave (HEAD `4dd5fc6`, branch `main`, all FF to origin):** **§11.4.111 wrong-destination negative control added to all 5 hermetic harnesses + FINDINGS §7 (next hardening) designed.** `4dd5fc6`: after each positive round-trip, the harness probes the peer's service on the UNDERLAY IP `10.9.0.2` and asserts it FAILS (the peer binds the WG-only overlay `10.10.0.2`, so a positive success could only have traversed `wg0` — reachability-as-proof made self-evidencing, not structural-only); a wrong-destination SUCCESS ⇒ fail-closed. **Independent §11.4.142 review ran TWO rounds (iterate-to-GO §11.4.134):** round 1 caught a REAL tautology (§11.4.107(10)) — `hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh` probed `/payload.txt` but `rm`'d `$SRVDIR` BEFORE the probe, so a reachable underlay 404'd and `NEG-OK` printed unconditionally (proven by the reviewer binding the peer to `0.0.0.0`: pre-fix the harness wrongly PASSed); fix = defer the `SRVDIR` cleanup to AFTER the control, so post-fix bind-`0.0.0.0` ⇒ `WG_FAIL … unexpectedly served the payload` exit 1 (control now load-bearing), NORMAL still PASS, `WG_MUT=badkey` tooth still fires, 3/3 deterministic; round 2 re-verified ⇒ GO. The other 4 controls (bridge/ftp/webdav/email) were proven load-bearing in round 1 (each FAILs when its peer binds `0.0.0.0`). Part (b) (`/usr/sbin/wg` preflight) was already satisfied in all 5 — verified, no redundant edit (§11.4.6). `FINDINGS.md` Rev 3 §7 designs the next hardening — the **underlay-sniff AF_PACKET non-leak differential** (assert WG ciphertext `0x04` present + plaintext nonce absent on the underlay), cited §11.4.99/§11.4.150, **queued as task #63** (blocked-by #62, now unblocked). Anti-bluff win: a decorative `NEG-OK` that gated nothing was REFUSED by review, not shipped. **Next: task #63 (underlay-sniff) — the loop continues (no tag — "keep hardening").** **Rev-15 wave (HEAD `3b73f02`, branch `main`, all FF to origin):** **H2.email promoted + all hermetic promotions wired into the standing suite as regression guards.** `71e0bac` added `test_vpn_lan_hermetic()` to `tests/run-tests.sh` — the 4 hermetic harnesses (`hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh`, `hermetic_bridge_run.sh`/Cast-eureka, `hermetic_ftp_run.sh`, `hermetic_webdav_run.sh`) now run on every suite invocation as **§11.4.135 standing regression guards** under a SKIP-aware verdict map (`rc0+PASS≥1+FAIL0⇒PASS; rc0+SKIP≥1+PASS0+FAIL0⇒SKIP; else FAIL`), independent §11.4.142 review GO (7/7 adversarial HOLD; 4/4 real + 7/7 synthetic mapping). `3b73f02` landed **H2.email**: `hermetic_email_run.sh` runs the **UNMODIFIED** `email_roundtrip.sh` autonomously over the tunnel via a pure-stdlib implicit-TLS mail peer (SMTPS 465 / IMAPS 993 / POP3S 995, shared in-memory mailbox) bound to the WG-only overlay `10.10.0.2` (reachability = tunnel-traversal proof §11.4.111). **Independent §11.4.142 adversarial review = GO, no blocking findings (§11.4.134):** NORMAL PASS all 4 scored legs (imaps_login_list, smtp_submission_send, pop3s_retrieve_roundtrip, open_relay_refused; email_reverse_leg SKIP N/A), `MAIL_MUT=openrelay`→real `FAIL: open_relay_refused` (only that leg), `MAIL_MUT=droptoken`→real `FAIL: pop3s_retrieve_roundtrip` (only that leg) — **both teeth load-bearing + targeted**; 3/3 deterministic (§11.4.50); §11.4.10 no cred/key leak (AUTH base64 = server RFC 4954 challenges only); clean cleanup (§11.4.14); `wg0-mullvad` untouched (§11.4.174). The close_notify fix (`tls.unwrap()` before close) + IMAP bare-QUIT clean-close eliminate the silent-SKIP-masking class (§11.4.6) — all legs ran live; builder self-debug (§11.4.102) also fixed the PoC `shutdown()` self-recursion + an IMAP `-ign_eof` hang. `FINDINGS.md`→Rev 2 (**§6 implicit-TLS mail deep-research** §11.4.150: PEP 594 `smtpd` removal, RFC 8314/5321/4954/3501/1939, the close_notify FACT + sources) + companion `hermetic_email_run.md` Rev 1, all HTML+PDF synced 0-fence-leak (§11.4.168). **Honest gate verdict (§11.4.6): the clean zero-install protocol-promotion set is now COMPLETE (Cast-eureka + FTP + WebDAV + email).** Remaining legs genuinely operator-gated (§11.4.122/§11.4.3): SFTP (no `sshd`), SMB/NFS (no samba/nfsd), `discovery_reflect.sh` scored leg (no `avahi-browse` client), ADB (device), container (podman). **Follow-up (separate reviewed batch): explicit wrong-destination negative (underlay/wg-down MUST-fail) to make §11.4.111 self-evidencing + wg-preflight `/usr/sbin/wg` across sibling harnesses.

Both harnesses additionally **scrub ambient-shell sibling-leg env vars** before invoking the promoted test (§11.4.50 determinism, independent-review nit — false-negative guard, never a bluff PASS). **All verified GREEN: FTP normal+teeth, WebDAV normal+teeth (207 through proxy, self-fetch body 779 B), both 3/3 deterministic; independent §11.4.142 review returned GO on both.** WebDAV harness was drafted by a session-limit-crashed builder subagent, resumed residue-clean per §11.4.147. Feature Status bumped to **Rev 3 (new §J)** + Status_Summary Rev 3 + companion docs `hermetic_ftp_run.md` (Rev 2) / `hermetic_webdav_run.md` (Rev 1) + research `FINDINGS.md`, all with synced HTML+PDF (0 fence-leaks §11.4.168). **Honest gate verdict (§11.4.6):** the clean zero-install promotion set is now COMPLETE (Cast-eureka+FTP+WebDAV); SFTP needs `sshd` (absent, no stdlib SSH server), SMB/NFS need samba/nfsd, `discovery_reflect.sh` scored leg hard-requires the absent `avahi-browse` client, ADB/container need device/podman — all genuinely operator-gated (§11.4.122/§11.4.3). **Email (SMTP-implicit-TLS + POP3S/IMAPS) is pure-stdlib-feasible and under active de-risking** — a standalone TLS-mail PoC subagent (`ac86a45fcd50747dd`) is in flight before any `hermetic_email_run.sh`. **Next: on PoC GO, build+review+land H2.email; the loop continues (no tag — "keep hardening").** **Rev-13 wave (HEAD `b76065c`, branch `main`, all FF to origin):** **hermetic-harness H0-FULL DONE — a REAL encrypted kernel-WireGuard tunnel round-trip proven autonomously (`b76065c`).** The planned `wireguard-go` build was unnecessary: the host `wireguard` **kernel module** works inside an unprivileged userns netns (`ip link add wg0 type wireguard` + `wg set` succeed under `unshare -Ur`; `/usr/sbin/wg` present) — so H0-full is zero-build/zero-dep/no-package-install/no-podman/no-Mullvad/no-root. `tests/vpn_lan/hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh`: veth underlay (10.9.0.x) carries the encrypted WG UDP, wg0 overlay (10.10.0.x) is the tunnel, a real HTTP payload served on the WG-only `10.10.0.2` and fetched over the tunnel — **`wg show`: latest-handshake=1782947082 rx=452 tx=752**, sha256 verified, **3/3 deterministic (§11.4.50)**; **golden-bad `WG_MUT=badkey` → hs=0/rx=0 → round-trip breaks** (§11.4.107(10)/§11.4.68 — `rx=0` proves the WG crypto gates the traffic, not the veth underlay). **Next: H1/H2** — run real peer services (smbd/vsftpd/webdav/eureka/mDNS, unprivileged) + wire `HELIX_BRIDGE_MODE=hermetic` into `tests/lib/svord_bridge.sh` so the protocol tests run INSIDE the namespace over the tunnel, promoting the 16 operator-gated SKIPs to AUTONOMOUS (§11.4.52). **Rev-12 wave (was HEAD `f96da56`, branch `main`, all FF to origin):** consolidation + a game-changing autonomous-validation path. `70f0636` **README §11.4.57 doc-link table completed** — all 6 Status pairs listed (the 2 VPN-LAN pairs were missing). `89cfd21` `.gitignore` `.tmp_export/` doc-export scratch (§11.4.30). **`1faead5` + `f96da56` — the hermetic-WireGuard test-harness path (deep research, §11.4.150/§11.4.52):** a loopback WireGuard pair in **unprivileged** network namespaces (`unshare -Ur -n` ⇒ root-in-userns + userspace `wireguard-go`, the `cmusatyalab/wireguard4netns` pattern) would let the **16 operator-gated protocol tests run AUTONOMOUSLY** against a controlled peer — **gated on NEITHER the broken podman NOR the live Mullvad bridge**.

## 1. Current PHASE

**§11.4.126 autonomous hardening loop** — construction (P0–P10 fail-closed) is
landed; the loop is now closing hardening gaps under all §11.4.169 test types
with real captured evidence **AND has opened a new feature workstream: VPN-LAN
service access** (operator mandate — reach/use all mainstream services on the far
side of the svord_toolkit VPN). The authoritative phased tracker is
`docs/design/vpn_lan_access/PLAN.md` (§11.4.172, 12 phases). Phase 0 (env-var
bridge scaffold + svord-doctor) is in flight via a subagent; Phase 8 (Miracast
§11.4.112 verdict) + a control-plane coverage push run in parallel. Operator
decision in force: **"keep hardening, don't tag yet."** The Go control-plane (stores, health-publisher, acl-helper,
config-compiler, P5b breaker/failover, P6 control-API/SSE/metrics/PAC/mTLS)
builds + vets + gofmt-clean and is proven unit / integration / config-parse; the
`dynamic` compose profile boots live and the **fail-closed data-plane proof is
GREEN**. Base proxy UP on `:53128` (204); host ~43%; 4 `helixproxy_*` Podman
secrets present (enable dynamic re-boot).

**P10 VPN fail-closed — GREEN (§11.4.68/.115/.108):**
`tests/dynamic/vpn_failclosed_test.sh` proven live — booted the dynamic stack,
forced the tunnel DOWN via Redis `vpn:status`, tunnel-DOWN ⇒ branded 503
`ERR_TUNNEL_DOWN` ×3 (real 3132-byte page), `leak_seen=0`, Squid PID unchanged;
deterministic ×3 (§11.4.50) + RED polarity guard FAILs a fabricated 200 leak
(§11.4.115). Real-VPN-egress half is operator-gated SKIP (gluetun WireGuard
creds §11.4.21). Evidence `qa-results/dynamic/vpn_failclosed/20260701T130115Z/`.
Re-runnable boot recipe: 4 external Podman secrets from
`tests/observability/gen_test_mtls.sh` → `./start --dynamic` (backgrounded) →
poll `proxy-squid` Up + compiler renders `dynamic-routing.squid` →
`HELIX_DYNAMIC_STACK=1 GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 ionice -c 3 bash
tests/dynamic/vpn_failclosed_test.sh`; restore base after: `./stop && ./start`.

**2 real security fixes (config-security review, `docs/design/security/Status.md`
Rev 2) — RED→GREEN + sink-side evidence + standing guards:**
- Squid header/version-hygiene (`4f983ee`): `via off` + `forwarded_for delete` +
  `httpd_suppress_version_string on` + `visible_hostname helix-proxy` in
  `squid.conf` + `squid.dynamic.conf`. The `Via: 1.1 proxy-squid (squid/6.13)`
  leak was CONFIRMED live (RED) → GONE (GREEN). Guard: `proxy_acl_security.sh`
  S3. **Root-cause note:** single-file `:ro` bind mounts pin the inode → config
  edits need a container **recreate** (`./stop && ./start`), NOT `squid -k
  reconfigure` (re-reads the stale inode).
- Dante SOCKS5 SSRF (`4626f05`): `command: connect` + `socks block` for 127/8,
  169.254/16, 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 in `sockd.conf`. 5 internal targets
  refused fast (code 000 ~0.01s, dante-log `block(N)`), external control 204, no
  public-egress regression. Guard: `proxy_acl_security.sh` S4.

**2 items TRACKED-for-operator (§11.4.101 connectivity-risk, NOT autonomously
fixed):** (1) Squid `dns_nameservers 8.8.8.8` bypasses the DoT dnsproxy → DNS
leak in **static** mode (dynamic mitigated by `never_direct`); re-point = risk.
(2) Dante `socksmethod none` + `client pass from:0.0.0.0/0` open-relay if
`:51080` escapes the bridge; client-CIDR restriction = risk. O(1) table in
`docs/design/security/Status.md`.

**§11.4.169 hardening matrix (`docs/design/hardening/Status.md` Rev 3) — 9 PASS /
2 honest SKIP:** PASS = stress+chaos, DDoS(300/300), concurrency(40, crosstalk=0),
memory(ratio 1.0017), **P10 fail-closed**, **race/deadlock (0 DATA RACE, 11
pkgs)**, **benchmark (200/200, p50=86ms/p95=88ms/p99=91ms, 10.84 req/s)** +
unit/integration. SKIP (honest §11.4.3) = security ACL live-deny (no autonomous
deny topology) + P10 egress-half (gluetun creds).

**Remaining actionable (non-operator-gated) is thinning.** Operator-gated:
2 TRACKED security items (connectivity risk), LE Phase 4/6, P10 real-egress
(gluetun creds), HelixQA vendoring (6 un-vendored siblings), release tag.

## 3. PROVEN-NOW vs OWED-TO-P10 (honest §11.4.6)

### PROVEN-NOW (control-plane / config-plane / spike facts — captured)
- **Existing proxy serves LIVE (BUGFIX-0002)** — after the rootless-Podman
  log-dir fix, the booted `--no-vpn` stack proves all 3 existing features:
  HTTP forward proxy `200` + `Via: 1.1 proxy-squid`, Dante SOCKS5 `200`, squid
  cache `TCP_MEM_HIT` (no origin contact). Guard:
  `tests/regression/log_dir_writable_test.sh` (§11.4.115 polarity, §1.1 mutation
  byte-identical md5 `0128a96b6d467c2da5b7cef8a808e563`). Evidence:
  `qa-results/regression/bugfix38/`.
- **P5b breaker/failover** (`internal/breaker`, gobreaker/v2) — per-target
  circuit breaker + tunnel tier-failover, TDD.
- **P6 control-API** (`cmd/api` + `internal/api` + `internal/pac`) — REST CRUD +
  SSE + Prometheus `/metrics` + PAC, **fail-closed mTLS**
  (`RequireAndVerifyClientCert`), coherent operator-wiring contract
  (`CONTROL_API_TLS_CERT/_KEY/_TLS_CLIENT_CA`, `:58080`); builds + vets clean,
  §1.1 mutation md5 `67125c7a1ab9b00c98fb164f765b04af`.
- **Spec §20 gaps G1–G4 resolved** with transient-spike captured evidence
  (`docs/research/mvp/findings/F_spikes_G1-G4.md`, run-id
  `qa-results/spikes/20260630_205029_g1g4/`): G2 `ubuntu/squid:latest` = Squid
  **6.13** (not v8), §8 directive set `squid -k parse` exit 0; G4 gluetun **v3.40
  (=v3.40.4)** control-API `:8000` answers 200, issue #3060 confirmed; G1 kernel-WG
  interface **creatable rootless** with `--cap-add NET_ADMIN`; G3 Dante **SIGHUP
  preserves an active SOCKS session** (20/20 chunks, curl exit 0, `/proc/net/tcp`
  ESTABLISHED proof).
- **P2 stores** (pgx + go-redis) — fail-closed, TDD, exercised against **real PG /
  Redis**.
- **P3 vpn-health-publisher** (`cmd/healthd` + `internal/vpn`) — data-plane health
  poll → Redis state, fail-closed, TDD.
- **P4 config-compiler + templates** — Squid 6.13 (`%>ha{Host}`) + Dante
  (concatenation, no `include`) render from PG; **`squid -k parse` exit 0**; PAC +
  route-key seeding parse-verified.
- **P5a acl-helper** — Squid `external_acl` OK/ERR from Redis, **fail-closed**,
  stdlib-only.
- **P7.2 observability** config plan — **promtool-validated** Prometheus scrape +
  Grafana dashboard.
- **P7.1 DNS / P7.3 security** — config plans only (DoH/DoT per-tunnel; per-user
  auth + Podman-secret loader + in-netns kill-switch). Design + parse layer.
- **Existing-test bluff audit** (Stream E) — 8 bluffs across 4 scripts catalogued
  (§11.4.138), guards owed to P8.

### CAPTURED-AT-P10 (fail-closed data-plane proof — the dynamic stack HAS booted)
The `dynamic` compose profile (postgres + redis + control-plane + squid+helper +
dante) now **boots live**; the fail-closed half of the usability proof is
captured:
- `graceful_503` — **PROVEN**: tunnel DOWN (Redis `vpn:status`) → branded 503
  `ERR_TUNNEL_DOWN` ×3 (3132-byte page) with **Squid PID unchanged**;
  deterministic ×3 + RED-polarity guard. Evidence
  `qa-results/dynamic/vpn_failclosed/20260701T130115Z/`.
- `no_leak` (tunnel-down case) — **PROVEN**: `leak_seen=0` during the DOWN window
  (no target reached while the tunnel is down).

### OWED-TO-P10 (real-VPN-egress half — credential gate CLEARED 2026-07-02; proxy-data-plane e2e still owed)
**UPDATE 2026-07-02 (§11.4.7):** the gluetun-WireGuard-credential gate that blocked this
whole section is **RESOLVED** — a persistent one-device Mullvad WireGuard identity is
registered + stored (§11.4.10, gitignored `.env`), and **live Mullvad egress is PROVEN via
gluetun** (rootless podman kernelspace WG tunnel, relay `cz-prg-wg-101`,
`am.i.mullvad.net/json` → `mullvad_exit_ip=true`, exit IP `146.70.129.117` Prague CZ;
evidence `qa-results/verification/mullvad_egress_20260702T161312Z/PROOF.txt`). What remains
owed is the PROXY-data-plane half + the up→drop tcpdump killswitch:
- `vpn_real_egress` — **gluetun-level PROVEN** (`mullvad_exit_ip=true` above); still owed:
  egress IP **via the proxy data-plane** `== tunnel exit && != host IP` **+ `wg
  transfer` Δ** (200 OK is not routing).
- `no_leak / killswitch` (up→drop case) — drop a *real* tunnel → **zero** target
  packets on the real uplink (`tcpdump`) + DNS only via the intended resolver.
- per-user **407 auth challenge** live; **secret injection leak-free** at runtime.
- **G1 residual** — full rootless kernel-WG *operation* (handshake + routing +
  throughput), only interface *creation* was spiked (§20 G1).
- **G3 residual / P9** — concurrent / repeated SIGHUP + **route-change-mid-session**
  SOCKS path behaviour (§20 G3).
- circuit-breaker open → failover to next up tier — **landed** (`6bdeef9`, P5b);
  live-under-load failover proof still owed.

## 4. Remaining phases

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| **P5b** | per-target circuit breaker + tunnel tier-failover (`sony/gobreaker/v2`) | ✅ landed `6bdeef9` |
| **P6**  | control-API + SSE + metrics + PAC + fail-closed mTLS | ✅ landed `62b22fe` (admin-UI templ/htmx + §11.4.170 host-rendered pixel proof = P6.2, deferred) |
| **P8**  | fix existing-test bluffs → §11.4.3 topology dispatch / honest SKIP / §11.4.161 + §11.4.135 guards | ✅ landed (`cd11494`/`4394643`/`2bc03de`/`8d95f8a`) |
| **P9**  | full test matrix + Challenges + HelixQA (all §11.4.169 types; G3 route-change-mid-session live test) | §11.4.169 matrix GREEN (9 PASS/2 SKIP); Challenges 2/3; HelixQA vendoring operator-gated (6 siblings) |
| **P10** | **live `dynamic`-mode boot + captured data-plane evidence = the usability proof** | ✅ **fail-closed half GREEN** (`567c9e1`); real-egress §11.4.21 credential gate **RESOLVED 2026-07-02** — persistent Mullvad WG identity stored (§11.4.10) + live gluetun egress PROVEN (`mullvad_exit_ip=true`, `qa-results/verification/mullvad_egress_20260702T161312Z/PROOF.txt`); proxy-data-plane-through-gluetun e2e = next step |
| **P11** | docs sync + HTML/PDF (+DOCX where mandated) exports (this CONTINUATION + .remember are part of it) | ongoing (this Rev 6 sync) |
| **P12** | whole-branch review (iterate-to-GO) + full retest + merge to `main` no-force + prefixed release tag | operator-gated — "keep hardening, don't tag yet" |

## 5. Binding constraints (non-negotiable)

- **Anti-bluff §11.4** — every PASS carries positive captured **data-plane**
  evidence; control-plane/config-parse green is necessary, never sufficient; the
  end-user-usability bar is met only at P10.
- **No force-push §11.4.113** — merge onto latest `main`, fast-forward only;
  force-push is forbidden with no exception.
- **Rootless Podman §11.4.161** — all containers rootless; no Docker-rootful, no
  sudo, no root escalation; orchestrate via the containers submodule (§11.4.76),
  build on the remote host (§11.4.173).
- **Secrets-as-names-only §11.4.10** — VPN creds / proxy-auth / mTLS keys via
  Podman secrets / file refs; **never** plaintext in git; `.env.example` documents
  refs only.
- **Operator-safe §11.4.174** — do **NOT** touch the operator's pre-existing
  resources: the host `wg0-mullvad` (UP kernel-WG) interface and any `lava-*`
  containers (e.g. `lava-postgres-thinker`) are off-limits; verify process/resource
  ownership before acting; block-don't-break on shared-host contention.
- **Host safety §12** — ≤60% memory (§12.6); no host power-state commands
  (CONST-033); pull images sequentially; `--rm` diagnostics; `df` first.

## 6. Resume now (next actionable)

1. `git fetch --all --prune` on **`main`** (operator: all work on main); confirm
   HEAD `860d38e` (== `main` == origin; integrate any newer foreign commit per
   §11.4.71, no force §11.4.113). The single canonical moment-valid resume file is
   `.remember/remember.md` (§11.4.131) — read it first. **Hermetic H0→H2 is DONE +
   HARDENED:** the H0-full real kernel-WireGuard tunnel (`hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh`) +
   the model-A protocol promotions over it are all landed + independently reviewed +
   wired into the standing suite as §11.4.135 guards (`test_vpn_lan_hermetic` in
   `tests/run-tests.sh`) — **all four protocol legs + the H0 substrate are wired; email
   wired `b66b2fa` (task #66), closing the §11.4.6 gap the §11.4.169 ledger audit caught
   (independent review confirmed all 5 rows PASS in the real loop)**. All 5 harnesses carry the §11.4.111 wrong-destination
   negative control (proven load-bearing — bind-`0.0.0.0` ⇒ harness FAILs). **The clean
   zero-install promotion set is COMPLETE (§11.4.6): Cast-eureka + FTP + WebDAV + email**
   all run AUTONOMOUSLY over the tunnel (unmodified protocol tests, stdlib peers on
   `10.10.0.2`, golden-bad teeth, 3/3 deterministic). Remaining protocol legs are
   genuinely operator-gated (§11.4.122/§11.4.3): SFTP (no `sshd`), SMB/NFS (no
   samba/nfsd), `discovery_reflect.sh` scored leg (no `avahi-browse` client), ADB
   (device), container (podman) — do NOT manufacture bluff harnesses for these.
   **The underlay-sniff AF_PACKET non-leak differential (task #63) is LANDED on the WG
   substrate** (`91af9c6`, `hermetic_wg_roundtrip.sh`, independent §11.4.142 review
   `a2b3c696` GO 11/11): during the positive round-trip it captures on the underlay
   `veth0` and asserts BOTH ciphertext present (type-4 `0x04` datagram to `:51820`) AND
   the per-run plaintext nonce ABSENT in raw underlay bytes; load-bearing golden-bad
   `SNIFF_MUT=plain` flips ONLY "plaintext absent" to FAIL (not a tautology, §11.4.107(10)),
   honest exit-3 on empty capture, honest `SNIFF-SKIP` when unavailable, 3/3 deterministic.
   FINDINGS §7/§7.1 → Rev 6 (IMPLEMENTED). **ALL ledger tasks #63-#76 LANDED/RESOLVED** (`91af9c6` underlay-sniff ·
   `cdb0ccd` ethertype guard · `85d8b32` sniff fan-out · `b66b2fa` email-wiring · `172eb5c` orphan-test ·

   correction of a prior PENDING) + **E2E honest §11.4.3 SKIP**, hardening Status Rev 6).
   **ANTI-BLUFF AUDIT LEDGER COMPLETE — 6 findings, all §11.4.118-discovered → RED-first fixed →
   §11.4.135-guarded:** F1 (#71/#72) · F-A/F-B (#73) · F-C/F-D (#74/#75) · F-E (#76); the core
   `tests/lib/evidence.sh` library is provably audited (8 verdict helpers — 7 fail-closed-solid + `assert_no_leak`
   F-E fixed). **The non-operator-gated actionable queue is now EXHAUSTED** — every tracked ledger task done,
   audit ledger closed, evidence library clean. **ALL remaining work is OPERATOR-GATED (surface per §11.4.66,
   never fake a PASS):** **live svord bridge** (biggest unlock — flips ~16 protocol SKIPs to live PASS + a full
   data-plane e2e), **LE #59** (Phase 4/6 credentials/DNS), **podman aardvark-dns compose-network** fix (restores
   the data-plane :53128/:51080 + the full-stack e2e), **real-device flash**, **HelixQA 6-sibling vendoring**.
   When re-engaging: a further §11.4.118 pass MAY audit the lower-traffic evidence.sh probes + the P10-pending
   analyzers (no live callers yet — no call-site bluff possible until wired). No release tag ("keep hardening").
   Run ONE netns owner at a time (§11.4.119). Design `docs/design/vpn_lan_access/hermetic_wg_test_harness.md` Rev 2.
2. **Continue the §11.4.126 autonomous hardening loop** (operator: "keep
   hardening, don't tag yet"). Base proxy UP `:53128` (204); ~43% host; 4
   `helixproxy_*` Podman secrets present. Keep dispatching 3–4 parallel
   non-data-plane subagents on remaining actionable items (§11.4.103); the data
   plane / `:53128` has a single owner (§11.4.119) — coordinate before any boot.
3. **P10 fail-closed — GREEN + guarded (`567c9e1`).** Real-VPN-egress half remains
   operator-gated on gluetun WireGuard creds (§11.4.21/.66). To re-run fail-closed:
   4 secrets from `tests/observability/gen_test_mtls.sh` → `./start --dynamic`
   (backgrounded) → `HELIX_DYNAMIC_STACK=1 … bash tests/dynamic/vpn_failclosed_test.sh`
   → restore base `./stop && ./start`.
4. **LE — issuance + renewal BOTH PROVEN (autonomous scope COMPLETE).** Phase 3
   hermetic DNS-01 issuance + Phase 5 zero-downtime renewal/rotation are
   cert-analyzer-verified, re-runnable, and guarded
   (`tests/letsencrypt/phase3_issuance_guard.sh` + `phase5_rotation_guard.sh`,
   wired in `run-tests.sh`); custom Caddy image via `deploy/letsencrypt/build.sh`;
   cert-analyzer self-test 37→55 (`8833ccc`). Phase 4 (LE-staging token §11.4.10)
   + Phase 6 (prod domain) OPERATOR-BLOCKED, **reason "operator-deferred DNS
   (2026-07-02)"** — operator deferred live DNS 2026-07-02; unblock = operator-provided
   LE account + DNS credentials (§11.4.21 Operator-Block-Details in the Status doc). The
   hermetic Phase-3/5 guards stay GREEN. Docs `docs/design/letsencrypt/Status.md` (Rev 4).
5. **Operator-gated queue (surface, don't autonomously break):** 2 TRACKED
   security items (Squid `dns_nameservers` DNS-leak, Dante client-side open-relay
   — both connectivity-risk §11.4.101); **LE Phase 4/6 — reason "operator-deferred DNS
   (2026-07-02)"** (unblock = operator LE account + DNS creds); **P10 real-egress — §11.4.21
   credential gate RESOLVED 2026-07-02** (Mullvad WG identity stored + live gluetun egress
   PROVEN; proxy-data-plane e2e still owed, §3 OWED-TO-P10); HelixQA vendoring (6
   un-vendored siblings, `docs/helixqa/UNBLOCK.md`);
   the release tag `helix_proxy-0.1.0-dev-0.0.2` (operator said don't tag yet).
6. Every change: TDD reproduce-first (§11.4.43/§11.4.115), all warranted test
   types (§11.4.169), paired §1.1 mutation, independent review → iterate-to-GO
   (§11.4.142/§11.4.125/§11.4.134), docs in sync (§11.4.60/§11.4.65/§11.4.106),
   operator resources untouched (§11.4.174: `wg0-mullvad`, `lava-*`, `whoami:58080`).
